## 1. Critical Issues Relating to Electronic Payment Systems

Electronic payments (E-payments) are transactions conducted through automated networks rather than the use of physical cash, cheque, or any other physical instrument. Technological advancements have introduced more convenient and efficient payment options.

Access devices include:

- Automated Teller Machines (ATMs)
- Point of Sale (POS) terminals
- Internet and mobile devices (used via credit/debit cards, bank transfers, etc.)

Customer education and awareness are essential to ensure the safety of funds and the individuals transacting.
